### So...

Suddenly, it occurred to me that I wanted to write an autobiograph when I was watching a video from Will Smith. He said that he planned to lose 20 lbs weight and write an autobiograph within 20 weeks. At that time, I realized that it's been a long time for me to rethink about myself, and what I had done.

I thought about what my autobiography would look like? Nothing, the "Nothing" means it would not be as complete as I want it to be, or as perfect as I want it. Then I just naturally turned to thinking about recording my daily, weekly, mothly, or yearly, with which the behavior of recording would remind me of keeping organzied, being more energetic,  studying hard or just away from wasting time.

I value what I write, then I don't want things I write give negative messages. It means that things/behaviors themselves should be powerful enough. Actually, every time when I think of Will Smith's movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, the most impressed scenario is "This part of my life is called ......". As I always imagine that someday when I look back on my past life, I would be able to define some part of them ...... it's a good feeling to make clear definitions to the bygones.

"How we decide to confront our fears that is the person we become. I decided to be funny."
There is no need for everyone to be funny, and of course there is no way for it. And today, just, accidentally today, an insight caught me that we all would be down to the world, as we will move beyond the narrow ego/self and feel endless hopelessness about humans. So why not try to be optimistic before the coming of destined ...... pessimistics?

"It (humor) is the ultimate defense. It's the ultimate protection......The funnier the person, the greater the pain." (Ramani)

"Nothing lasts forever. I promised myself that during the good times, I would plant and nurture the seeds of the next thing......I asked myself after television, what would be my next thing? There was only one answer: movies."

At the end of this video, I found some familiar actions/decisions I made, "protect myself......hide myself from the world, to hide the coward"
